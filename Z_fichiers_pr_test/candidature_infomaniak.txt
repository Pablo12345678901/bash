I) Please answer the following questions in a new text document:

    - What is the list of ips present in infomanihack.ch SPF (*) ?
        ip4:185.181.161.85
        ip6:2001:1600:4:9:f816:3eff:fe65:6827
        I found this answer by writing a bash script with information on the below webpage and also on man page of 'nslookup'.
        "How to check and read a Sender Policy Framework record for a domain :" https://support.mailessentials.gfi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015116520-How-to-check-and-read-a-Sender-Policy-Framework-record-for-a-domain

    - Where can you usually find DNS information on a Linux system ?
        On the file located at /etc/resolv.conf. Can be found by showing information with :
        cat -> cat /etc/resolv.conf (copy to STDOUT file content)
        less -> less /etc/resolv.conf (show file content)
        grep -> grep "nameserver" /etc/resolv.conf (the line containing 'nameserver' has the information about DNS)
        On recent Linux distributions, can also be found with :
        systemd-resolve -> systemd-resolve --status | grep "DNS Servers"

    - What is the abuse address of the 185.181.161.0/24 range (*) ?  
    The abuse adresse of this range is 'abuse@infomaniak.ch'.
    I found this result by writing a bash script with this the help of the below website showing how to use whois to get the abuse adress from domain and also with the man page of 'whois'.

    - Do you prefer using Vim or Emacs ?
    I am used to both as I modify configuration files (ex : 'bashrc' / 'bash_profile') through 'bash' with 'vim' command but the default keybinds of my 'bash' terminal is Emacs.
