This repo contains :

- a 'bin' dir with script currently in production with my OS. Most of them are sourcing the 'fonctions_personnelles' script that contains general customized functions. 

- another dir called 'scripts_in_dev_or_to_be_tested_before_pushed_to_production' with scripts in development, or previously used scripts (on other OS : MacOS, Guix, PureOs and Ubuntu) that therefore need to be tested/adapted before pushed to production into the 'bin' dir.

Please note that :
- my current OS is Arch Linux and that some commands used in the scripts were installed manually so you maybe will need to install them by yourself or process to adaptations in order to run them.
- some scripts use environment variable that should be set into the bash profile. The later should then be sourced if not rebooting your computer.
